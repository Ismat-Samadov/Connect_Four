## About the Game

Connect Four is a two-player game where the players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends either when one player achieves four in a row, or when the grid is full and no player has achieved four in a row.

- The game is played on a 6x7 grid.
- Players take turns dropping their discs into the grid.
- The game checks for a winner after each move.
